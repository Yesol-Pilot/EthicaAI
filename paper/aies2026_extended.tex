Can artificial agents develop genuine moral commitment beyond self-interest?
We formalize Amartya Sen's Meta-Ranking theory within a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework, implementing dynamic moral commitment ($\lambda_t$) conditioned on resource availability and Social Value Orientation. Tested across 8 environments with up to 1,000 agents, we demonstrate that Situational Commitment---morality conditional on survival---is the only Evolutionarily Stable Strategy. Extended analysis includes formal mechanism design properties (partial Incentive Compatibility), mechanistic interpretability (SVO accounts for 79.8\% of $\lambda_t$ determination), and policy simulations showing that 50\% meta-ranking adoption increases carbon emission reduction from 61.3\% to 64.3\% while reducing regulatory burden. Our 38-module reproduction pipeline generates all 74 figures from a single command.

\section{Introduction}
% 확장판: NeurIPS 본문 + 사회적 영향 분석 + 정책 시사점 강화
% Full content to be expanded from neurips2026_main.tex + supplementary sections on:
% - Ethical implications of meta-ranking (dual-use concerns)
% - Policy design principles derived from simulations
